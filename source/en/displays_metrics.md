# Reporting

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a variety of reports to help users assess network health and uptime and Display statistics. Proof of Play data offers further insights into content performance shown across your Display network to reveal trends to enable stakeholders to refine content scheduling and placement for improved targeting and audience engagement.

Reports can be viewed in real time, emailed as a PDF to users and saved for future reference as well as scheduled to run on a Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Yearly basis.

Available metrics can be found by selecting **All Reports** under the **Reporting** section of the main CMS menu.

Similar Reports are grouped together to make it easier to find the data you need, which are presented as Charts as well as Tabular data so you can easily identify patterns and trends.
