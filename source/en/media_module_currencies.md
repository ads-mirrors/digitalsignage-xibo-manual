The template will be automatically scaled and should be designed for the intended output resolution. The following guidelines should be considered when editing templates:

- Templates must be designed at a fixed size
- All elements must use absolute sizing in px, including fonts, margins, widths, heights, etc
- If positioning is used, it must be from top,left
- Templates can use bootstrap
- The aspect ratio will be fixed by [[PRODUCTNAME]] and sized to fit the Region
- Templates are treated the same as a static image
