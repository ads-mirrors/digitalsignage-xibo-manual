# Currencies

Display exchange rates for currency pairs anywhere on a Layout using **Elements** or select a **Static Template** to display results in Layouts/Playlists.

{feat}Currencies|v4{/feat}

The Currencies Widget relies in part on the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to retrieve exchange rate data which feeds into configured Elements and Static Templates.

## Currencies Elements

Elements are available for selection when adding the Currencies Widget to a [Layout](layouts_editor.html) to give Users more control over what components of the Currencies Widget to use and where they can be placed.

Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel.  Enter **Currencies** using their acronyms/abbreviations you wish to show as well as a **Base** currency from the **Configure** tab.

Control how items should be cycled by specifying a [Data Slot](layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding Global Elements to add shapes and text which can all be put into an Element Group for easier configuration and positioning.

## Currencies Static Templates

Static Templates define how returned data should be laid out and styled and are a simple way to show your data using pre-styled templates.
