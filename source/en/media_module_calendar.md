{feat}Calendar View|v3{/feat}

## Add Widget

Locate **Calendar** from the [Widget](layouts_widgets.html)  toolbar and click to **Add** or **Grab** to drag and drop to a Region.

On adding, configuration options are shown in the right hand properties panel:

- Provide a **Name** for ease of identification.
- Choose to override the default **duration** if required.


### Configuration

- Provide the iCal **URL** to link.

{tip}
Ensure that the ICS feed URL is available to the CMS. If the feed loads in a browser without authentication then the feed should display in the CMS without issue.

For further information on how to view your Google Calendar in applications, use the following link selecting the **Get your calendar (view only)** option: https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37648?hl=en

{/tip}

- Use the drop down to select the **type of calendar** to use to display events:

#### Schedule

- Include a **Message** to be shown when no events are returned.

- Use the **Interval** field to filter events for a certain period. Use natural language such as '1 day' or '2 weeks' to return the events within your chosen time frame.

- Tick the checkbox to enter a **Date range** instead with defined start and end dates.

  

#### Daily/Weekly

- Set **Start and End times** to define a window to show events.

{version}
NOTE: From v3.1.2, an additional option to remove Weekends is available for both Weekly and Monthy Calendar Types!
{/version}

#### All Calender Types have the following options:

- **Exclude all day events**  to remove from the feed so they won't be shown.
- **Exclude current events** to remove from the feed so they won't be shown.
- **Use event timezone** or deselect to use the CMS timezone instead.
- **Use calendar timezone** if the feed specifies that it's own timezone should be used. Deselect to use the CMS timezone.
- If your feed comes from **Windows** use this check box.

### Caching

Include a suitable time for the **Update Interval** in minutes, keeping it as high as possible. This determines how often data will be requested from the iCal feed. If the calendar is only ever modified with events scheduled days in advance, you can set this for a long period.

{tip}
It is best practice to contact a remote feed as little as possible.

## Trigger 

Use this tab to trigger a Web Hook **Action** when there is a **Current Event** or **No Event**!

{tip}

**Example Scenario**:

A user has a meeting room calendar configured using the Calendar Widget on a Layout which shows the current occupancy for a room and would like to change LED lights to show when vacant or in use.

- The user would first need to create **Shell Commands** which issued commands to an LED IoT device or the inbuilt LEDS's on some of the Philips Commercial Displays.
- Next an [Interactive Action](layouts_interactive_actions.html) would need to be defined on the **Layout**, which would **Navigate to Widget** and **Target the Screen**, with the **Shell Command Widgets** configured in the **Interactive Drawer**.
- Using the **Trigger** tab on the Calendar Widget, assign the code's to trigger the **Web Hooks** for **Current Event** and **No Event**.

See the [Command Functionality](displays_command_functionality) page for more information.

## Actions 

Interactive Actions can be attached to this Calendar Widget from the **Actions** tab in the properties panel. Please see the [Interactive Actions](layouts_interactive_actions.html) page for more information.
