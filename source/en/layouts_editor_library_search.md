# Using Library Searches

[[PRODUCTNAME]] supports a variety of file based Media types. Along with Image, Video and Audio files, show PDF's, PowerPoints as well as complete HTML Packages on your Displays. 

File based Media can be first uploaded to the **CMS Library** ahead of time, or added directly using the file uploader when creating **Layouts** and **Playlists**.

Media already saved to the Library, can be easily selected by using a **Library Search** function.

Available from the **Toolbox**, each **Media** file type can be viewed and added from here.

When using the **Other Media** search, use the **Type** drop down to select from the available options.

- Use filters to limit returned results for searches and make it easier to find the content to use.


New Media files can be directly uploaded and added by using the file uploader for a selected Media type.

- Drag and drop or click to add the uploader.


Once uploaded, the file will be added to the **CMS Library** and will be shown for future selection in relevant Library Searches.

## Pixabay 

Pixabay integration gives Users easy access to additional Image and Video resources from within the CMS.

Any Images/videos used from Pixabay will automatically be added to your CMS Library and made available for future use from the Image/Video Library Search functions.

Clicking in the top right of a thumbnail will play a preview in a separate window. This window can also be enlarged using the arrow in the top left and can be added to the canvas from here by clicking the `+` button at the top.
