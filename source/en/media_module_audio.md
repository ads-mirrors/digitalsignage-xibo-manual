Audio can also be attached to other Widgets using the Context Menu.

{tip}
When attaching to Widgets, Users can enter a Volume as well as a Loop parameter to determine whether the audio will loop for the duration of the attached Widget or just play through once. Audio will stop once the parent Widget finishes playing!
