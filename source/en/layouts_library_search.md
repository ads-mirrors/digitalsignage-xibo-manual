## Expiry Dates

Media uploaded directly to Layouts have the option to **Set Expiry Dates**

{feat}Widget Expiry Dates|v3{/feat}

{tip}
This is particularly useful should you need to preload media to be shown at a later date/time!
{/tip}

- Tick the **Set Expiry Dates** box.

![Expiry Dates](img/v3_media_image_expiry_dates.png)

- Select **Start** and **End** dates and times.

- Use the check boxes to remove the media file from the Playlist on expiry and delete from the Library.


- Click the **Start upload** button to begin the upload of all files added. If a Folder/Expiry Dates have been selected and there are multiple files to be added, all files will be uploaded to the specified location and have the same Expiry Dates set.
- Once successfully uploaded, click **Done**.

Files can also be uploaded individually and have different Folder locations/Expiry dates and times specified.
Instead of clicking on the Start upload button, click on the **blue upload** button shown at the end of the row for an added file. 

Change the Folder location using the **Select Folder** button as before and then click the blue button at the end of the row to upload just that singular file.
