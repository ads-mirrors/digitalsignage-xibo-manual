# Menu Boards: Products

Display data for Products held in a Menu Board anywhere on a Layout using **Elements**.

{feat}Menu Board: Products|v4{/feat}

The Menu Boards: Products Widget primarily consists of a Menu Board source which feeds into configured Elements.

[Menu Boards](media_menuboards.html) need to be created with added Products prior to adding the Menu Boards: Products Widget to Layouts.

## Product Elements

Elements are available for selection when adding a Menu Boards: Product Widget to a [Layout](layouts_editor.html) to give Users more control over what components of Menu Board Products to use and where they can be placed.

Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel. A Menu Board must be selected to use as the data source from the **Configure** tab for each Element used on the Layout. Control how items should be cycled by specifying a [Data Slot](layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding Global Elements to add shapes and text which can all be put into an Element Group for easier configuration and positioning.
