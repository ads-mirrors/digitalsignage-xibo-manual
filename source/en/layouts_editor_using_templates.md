# Using Templates

Use **Templates** to speed up the design process so that Users can customise content rather than having to start from scratch building Layout designs. Streamline content creation with pre-designed Layouts to allow Users to concentrate on the core content whilst maintaining company/industry visual set standards and guidelines.

## Published Layouts as Templates

Layouts created in the Layout Editor can be saved for future selection as a Template after Publishing:

- From the **Layout Editor**, open the top menu.
- From the drop down, select **Save Template**.
- Complete all the relevant form field, opting to include all Widgets to the Template design if required.
- **Save**.

Published Layouts can also be saved as a Template from the **Layouts** grid:

- Navigate to **Layouts** under the **Design** section of the main CMS menu.
- Use the row menu for a Published Layout and select **Save Template**.
- Complete form fields and **Save**.

{tip}
Layouts with the tag 'Template' will also add the Layout to your list of Template designs!
