# User Groups

User Groups are an easy way to configure [Features and Share](users_features_and_sharing.html) options to apply to multiple Users who are members of a particular User Group.

{tip}
User Groups makes it easier to onboard new Users and manage system access. Users will inherit the  Feature and Sharing options enabled for the group!
{/tip}

Create your own User Groups are select from a set of pre-configured groups, created to serve common functions in the CMS, available for new installations.

{version}
**Note:** Pre-configured User Groups are available for new v4 installations and for users who upgrade to v4 who have not previously utilised User Groups in  their earlier versions!
{/version}

![Pre-Configured Groups](img/v4_user_groups_preconfigured.png)

The pre-configured User Groups already have the required Features enabled to allow Users to carry out the chosen role. These can be modified if required to suit.

{version}
**Note:** The Display Manager User Group does not have the rights to add and authorise new Displays as this is a Super Admin high level function. Once added, a Super Admin user can add new Displays to [Folders](configure_folders.html) or give Share access rights to this User Group for Display Management purposes.
{/version}

## Create User Groups

User Groups are administered from **User Groups** under the **Administration** section of the main CMS menu. The User Group grid will open for you to add and manage User Groups:
