{version}
NOTE: If you are using a 1.8.x CMS, select Calendar from the Widget Toolbox to add!
{/version}

On adding, configuration options are shown in the Edit Calendar form:

- Provide a **Name** for ease of identification.
- Choose to override the default **duration** if required.

- Select whether the duration is to be per item or leave unticked to set the duration per feed.

### Configuration

![Calendar Configuration](img/v3_media_calendar_configuration.png)

- Provide the iCAL **URL** to link.

- Use the **Interval** field to filter events for a certain period. Use natural language such as '1 day' or '2 weeks' to return the events within your chosen time frame.

  {version}
  NOTE: From v3.0.0 users can select a **date range** to return events instead!
  {/version}

- Specify the **Number of items**/events you wish to display from the iCAL feed.

- Select to **Exclude all day events** and **Exclude current events** so that they are removed from the feed and not shown.

- Choose from the **event timezone** and **calendar timezone** to specify which timezone to use. If left unticked, the timezone that has been set in the CMS will be used.

- If your feed comes from **Windows** use the check box.

### Appearance

- Use the **Date Format** field to ensure that you show the appropriate date/time formats for your calendar events.  

  {tip}
  Take a look at the table at the bottom of this page for PHP date formats!
  {/tip}

- Use the checkbox to show calendar items side by side.

- Select an **Effect** using the drop-down menu to be used to transition between items.

- When an effect  is selected an additional option is shown to specify the number of events you wish to show per page.

  {tip}
  We would encourage users to opt for an effect when you have several events you wish to display, otherwise they will be shown as static lists.
  {/tip}

### Template

Click on the Template tab to show the Calendar Templates:

![Calendar Main Editor](img/v3_media_calendar_main.png)

- Include text merge fields from the **Snippets** menu to pull in the required event information from the Calendar. 

{version}

{/version}

{version}
NOTE: From v2.1.0 `[Date]` fields can include an optional format `[Date|format]` so that `[Date]` can be used multiple times in a Template with different formats to allow for different styling for each element of a date.

![Calendar Date Format](img/v3_media_calendar_dateformat.png)

{/version}

- Click to **Save**.


### Current Event Template

Set alternative text and formatting to show Current Events.  [[PRODUCTNAME]] will use the Players date/time to work out if the event showing is current and switch to the Current Event template.

Select **Current Event** from the Template tab

- Tick the box to Use an alternative template.

![Calendar Current Event](img/v3_media_calendar_current_events.png)

- Include text and select from the available **Snippets** to create a template to be used just for **Current Events**. 
- **Save** changes.

### No Data Template

This template allows a user to include a message to ensure that the intended audience is not left with blank displays when no events are returned from the iCAL feed.

### Optional Style Sheet

Include CSS to apply to the template structure.

### Caching

Include a suitable time for the **Update Interval** in minutes, keeping it as high as possible. This determines how often data will be requested from the iCAL feed. If the calendar is only ever modified with events scheduled days in advance, you can set this for a long period.

{tip}
It is best practice to contact a remote feed as little as possible.
{/tip}

## Trigger 

**Available from v3.0.0**

Use this tab to trigger a Web Hook **Action** when there is a **Current Event** or **No Event**!

{tip}

**Example Scenario**:

A user has a meeting room calendar configured using the Calendar Widget on a Layout which shows the current occupancy for a room and would like to change LED lights to show when vacant or in use.

- The user would first need to create **Shell Commands** which issued commands to an LED IoT device or the inbuilt LEDS's on some of the Philips Commercial Displays.
- Next an [Interactive Action](layouts_interactive_actions.html) would need to be defined on the **Layout**, which would **Navigate to Widget** and **Target the Screen**, with the **Shell Command Widgets** configured in the **Interactive Drawer**.
- Using the **Trigger** tab on the Calendar Widget, assign the code's to trigger the **Web Hooks** for **Current Event** and **No Event**.

See the [Command Functionality](displays_command_functionality) page for more information.

## Actions
