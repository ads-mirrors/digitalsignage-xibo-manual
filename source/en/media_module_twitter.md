The template will be automatically scaled and should be designed for the intended output resolution. The following guidelines should be considered when editing templates:

- Templates must be designed at a fixed size

- If positioning is used, it must be from top,left
- Templates can use bootstrap
- The aspect ratio will be fixed by [[PRODUCTNAME]] and sized to fit the Region
- Templates are treated the same as a static image
  {/tip}

Once override has been selected, click back on the **Templates tab** to select templates to edit:

![Twitter Override the Template](img/v3.1_media_twitter_override_template.png)

  {/version}

**Optional Stylesheet** - This is the CSS to apply to the template structure above.

{tip}
This optional template is intended for advanced users to 'tweak' the CMS generated output!
{/tip}

### Caching

Include a suitable time for the Update Interval in minutes, keeping it as high as possible. This determines how often the Module will request data from the feed.
