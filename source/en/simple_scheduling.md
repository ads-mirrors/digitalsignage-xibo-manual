# Simple Scheduling

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a variety of scheduling tools in order to deliver the right content at the right location at the right time.

All content to be shown on authorised Displays must be included in a Schedule. Displays check for new scheduled content periodically and will download any new items in advance of playback ready to be shown.

You may have a Layout created by a member of your team, in order to share an important announcement within a company, which is now Published and ready to be shown on Displays.

## Creating a Schedule

- Click on **Schedule** from the main CMS menu.
- Click the **Add Event** button.

Complete the fields in the **Schedule Event** form:

- Give the event a **Name** for easier identification in the CMS.
- Use the **Event Type** drop down to select the type of Event to Schedule. For this example, select **Layout**.
- Select which **Displays** to show the Layout on. 
- From **Dayparting**, choose **Always** to show the Layout on Displays constantly or select **Custom** to set specific start and end dates/times.
- Select the **Use Relative time** option if the Layout should be shown immediately and provide how long it should remain showing on Displays by providing hours and minutes.
- Use the drop down to select the **Layout** to show.
- Click **Save.**

The CMS will now update a Schedule change and show the Layout on Displays for the specified time.

The Scheduled Event can be viewed/edited from the Schedule grid and Calendar views.

## FAQ's

***Can I create Schedules from other parts of the CMS?***

Yes, the Schedule Event form is available from the row menu for Layouts, Campaigns, Playlists and the Media grid for Images and Videos. Once a Layout has been published, it can also be Scheduled directly from the Layout Editor.

***How do I remove an Always Event from the Schedule?***

From the Schedule, use the row menu for the Event in the Grid view and select Delete, or click on the Event icon from the Calendar to open the Edit Event form and Delete.

***How can I see what will be shown on a Display at a specific point in time?***

Use Agenda from the range filter to see a precise representation of what Layouts/Campaigns will be shown on a selected Display. Use the slider to pinpoint the exact time of day to view.
