# Display Settings 

Each Display has settings which can be configured individually. Settings can vary depending on the platform/media player type, using **Display Setting Profiles** you can easily apply different settings to **Displays** of the same platform or type.

Once connected to the CMS, each **Display** is assigned a default **Display Profile** to apply settings to Displays of the corresponding type.

Profiles can be customised or new ones added to suit Display requirements. For ease use the row menu and **Copy** an existing **Profile** to quickly create new Profiles with the required settings.

Use Display Profiles to provide your **Licence Pool Code** to all of your Displays centrally for easier licensing which is less prone to error than entering codes manually per device.

Create Display Profiles to cater for Landscape and Portrait **orientations** or to apply different **operating hours** or a Display Profile for devices that require **multiple decoders** enabled for example.

If individual Displays require different settings from those set in a Display Profile, override settings by editing the Display from the Displays grid.
