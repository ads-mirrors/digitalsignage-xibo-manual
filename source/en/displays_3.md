# Displays

{tip}

**Please note:**

- If you are using a v3.3.0 or later CMS, please click [here](displays.html)

- If you are using a CMS earlier than v3.0.0 please click [here](displays_2.html)

The primary purpose of [[PRODUCTNAME]] is to show content on screens with the entire application suite existing for that one purpose. [[PRODUCTNAME]] provides a concept called **Displays** to manage when and how content is shown on a screen.

{tip}
When no other content is Scheduled, or if there is an issue that prevents the scheduled Event from showing, we highly recommend that a **Default Layout** is set so that something is **always** shown on Displays! You can create your own Default Layout to replace the existing one, but keep in mind that designs should be kept simple with no complex media or web content.  Edit a Display to select or use the Row Menu and click on Default Layout to select your designed Layout from the dropdown menu.

**Please note**: If no Default Layout is set or there is an issue with the Default Layout that has been set, the splash screen will be shown on Displays!

{/tip}

Displays are uniquely identified by a **hardware key** which is generated when the Signage Player software is installed. This hardware key is used to create a Display record in the CMS and is unique to that one Display record.

## Connecting a Display

Displays connect to the CMS over an API called "XMDS" {nonwhite}(Xibo Media Distribution Service){/nonwhite} with most Players only requiring the URL and CMS Key. 

Alternatively, Displays can be added by providing a 6 character ‘Activation Code’ in the **Displays** page of the CMS.

**Please note:** Using the **Add Display (Code)** in the CMS to connect a Display is currently only supported for **Android Players** from v2 R204 and **Windows Players** (from v2 R202/R252). We are working on supporting this connection method for all Players.

{tip}
New Displays will need to be marked as **Authorised** before they can be sent any content. This can be done by using the Row Menu for the Display and clicking the **Authorise** action.
{/tip}

## Display Administration

Displays are administered in the CMS from clicking on **Displays** under the **Administration** section of the main menu.  The Displays [Grid](tour_grids.html) will open for you to add new and manage exiting Displays.

![Display Administration Grid](img/v3_displays_administration_grid.png)


Click the Folders icon to toggle on/off from view.  

{tip}
When Folders are hidden from view, the file path for the selected folder will be shown!
{/tip}

- Click on a Folder/sub-folder to search the contents and return results based on any filters applied to the grid.

or

- Tick **All Folders** to include searching in the Root Folder and return results based on any filters applied to the grid.

Check out the [Folders](/manual/en/tour_folders.html) page for further information.

{tip}
Logged in Users will only view the status of Displays that they have been given access to!
{/tip}

**ID** - Used for internal identification of the Display only.

**Display** - Name given to the Display for easy identification purposes within the CMS (this is not shown on the Display itself).

**Status** -  *Tick* = Player is up to date (this may also show as green in colour).
				*Cloud Icon* =  Player has not logged in with content waiting to be downloaded (this may also show as amber in colour, as above)
				*Cross* = Player is currently downloading new content and has yet to complete the download (this may also show as red in colour)	

**Authorised** - Tick or cross to indicate whether the Display has been granted a licence with the CMS. This prevents unauthorised Displays being added to the CMS.

{tip}
Include the **Commercial License** column using the **Column Visibility** button to easily identify the Commercial Licence status of your Displays!
{/tip}

**Logged In** - Tick or cross to show if the Display has logged in recently.

**Last Accessed** - Date and time stamp of when the Display was last accessed. 

**MAC Address** - Media Access Control Address of the Display (if the Player software is capable of sending it).

{tip}
Use the **Column visibility** button to select from the available options to show the information you would like to display for your administration purposes. Deselect to remove a column from the Displays grid!
{/tip}

## Row Menu

Each Display has a Row Menu containing a number of actions that can be performed:



![Displays Row Menu](img/v3_displays_row_menu.png)

{tip}
Selected actions allow for [Forms](tour_forms.html) to be automatically submitted by clicking on the action from the Row Menu, such as **Authorise** and **Check Licence**. Actions that have an auto submit capability will display an option to enable. Take a look at [Grids](tour_grids.html) for further information!
{/tip}



### Manage

Each Display has its own **Dashboard** which shows the Displays current status, bandwidth usage, file status and errors.

![Manage Dashboard](img/v3_displays_manage_dashboard.png)



{tip}
This Dashboard is useful as a first step to look at when troubleshooting issues with a Display!
{/tip}

### Edit

Clicking on **Edit** opens the Edit Display form which contains tabs with configuration options.

![Edit Form](img/v3_displays_edit_form.png)

{tip}
The unique hardware key that is generated during installation is shown on the General tab for the selected Display!
{/tip}

### Folders

Displays can be optionally saved to [Folders](tour_folders.html) using the **Edit form** or from the **Select Folder** option on the Row Menu.

{tip}
Displays that are saved in Folders will inherit the View, Edit, Delete Share options that been applied to the destination Folder for the User/User Group!

Assign multiple Displays to a Folder using the **With Selected** option at the bottom of the grid!
{/tip}

### Tags

Displays can be tagged for organisation and to make it easier to find a large number of Displays all grouped by [Tags](tour_tags.html).  When entering text into the Tag field on the form, an auto complete helper will show possible matches to make it easier for Users to select from.

#### Override Display Profile Settings for individual Displays

Use the **Profile Settings** tab to see the settings applied from the selected [Display Settings Profile](displays_settings.html).

![Displays Edit Profile Settings](img/displays_edit_profilesettings.png)

Click the edit icon to change selected settings to override the Profile.

#### Set Bandwidth Limits per Display

Use the **Advanced** tab to apply a limit to determine the amount of bandwidth that a **Display** can consume.

![Displays Bandwidth](img/v3_displays_edit_advanced_bandwidth.png)

{tip}
Set bandwidth limits for multiple Displays using the With Selected option at the bottom of the grid!
{/tip}

### Delete

Deleting a **Display** will remove it from the **CMS** entirely - this operation cannot be reversed. A deleted Display can be reconnected to the CMS by repeating the “Register” procedure which will create a new unique Display record.

{tip}
**Deauthorise** a Display instead of deleting so that it can be re-authorised at a later date if needed. Use the row menu for the Display and click on **Authorise** to toggle to **Deauthorise**. This can also be actioned from the **Edit Display** form by selecting **No** for Authorise display.
{/tip}

### Send Command

The **Send Command** functionality is executed via XMR to Players by selecting a predefined command. This is useful for sending Players 'Reboot' commands for example.

![Displays Send Command](img/displays_send_command.png)

{tip}
This type of [Command](displays_command_functionality.html) can also be executed by scheduling a [Command Event](scheduling.html#Events)
{/tip}

### Transfer Display to another CMS

**Please note:** This feature is currently not supported on Tizen and Linux Players. We are currently working to bring this feature to all Players but at present this feature is only available for Windows Players from v2 R201, Android Players from v2 R203 and webOS from R204.  

To use this functionality you will first need to activate Google Authenticator using [Two factor Authentication](tour_two_factor_authentication.html), if you have not already set this up.

![Display Transfer Google Authenticator](img/displays_transfer_cms_google_authenticator.png)

Once activated, click on **Displays** from the CMS main menu and use the Row Menu to click on  **Transfer to another CMS** for the selected Display you want to transfer.

Ensure all the form fields are completed by:

- Entering the full **CMS URL** you wish to transfer this Display to.
- Providing the **CMS Secret Key** for the CMS Address you wish to transfer to.
- Complete the **Two Factor authentication code**, as displayed on the app.![Transfer CMS](img/displays_move_cms.png)

Once the details provided have been authenticated, the Display will attempt registration with the 'new' CMS. Once the Display has been successfully transferred the Display will stop communicating with the 'old' CMS and will change from a 'tick' to a `X` in the **Authorised** column.

{tip}
Select multiple Displays to transfer using the **With Selected** option at the bottom of the grid!
{/tip}

{tip}
Certain Actions from the Row Menu have the option to be 'automatically submitted', see [Grids](tour_grids.html) for further information!
