Click the **edit icon** in the **Preview** window to open the inline editor to enter text and apply formatting.



![Enter Text](img/v3_media_text_inline_editor.png)



The text editor will open with the same background as selected for the Layout and will use a complimentary text colour for the chosen background colour.

The thin red border in the text editing window represents the **Region** size. Ensure that formatted text remains within this border.

Optionally include date/time merge tags, available from the **Snippets** menu. 

{version}
NOTE: From v2.1.0, [Date] tags can include an optional [Date|format] so that [Date] can be used multiple times in a Template each with different formats!
{/version}

Configuration options are shown in the Edit Text form:

- Provide a **Name** for ease of identification.
- Choose to override the default **duration** if required.

### Effect

- Select an **Effect** to use from the dropdown menu.
- Include a **Speed** for the selected effect.
- Include a selector to use for stacking marquee items in a line when scrolling left/right.

**Additional Fonts** can be added to this editor by uploading files to the **Library**. Please be aware that fonts have 'preferences' built into them known as OS/2 tags. [[PRODUCTNAME]] checks these OS/2 preferences, and can use fonts with OS/2 tags 0 or 8. Fonts with other tags may not display correctly or you may receive an error on upload.

Interactive Actions can be attached to this Text Widget from the **Actions** tab in the properties panel. Please see the [Interactive Actions](layouts_interactive_actions.html) page for more information.

## Date Format - PHP

Date / time can be formatted by providing "tokens" that sit between square brackets [] in the template area.
