This grid is used to determine which Transitions are available for assignment to Media items.

- **Fly** - Fly in or out on a compass point.

**Please note:** When Transition Defaults are applied to a Widget, the fields will show as blank fields.

Only **manually** entered Transitions will show in the form fields.

## Playlist Transitions

Transitions between two **Media items** on a Playlist are called **Playlist Transitions**. They are used to transition between two media items and are set as **In** and **Out** transitions.

{tip}
The Transition form adapts depending on the Transition selected and the options available for that transition. In most cases it is necessary to select a duration for the Transition in Milliseconds and in the case of Fly, a direction must also be selected.

## Region Exit Transition

A Region Exit Transition happens when the last Media Item to be displayed in a Region is shown. This only occurs once **all Media items** have expired in the other Regions and can have a different Transition set. This Transition is set on the Region itself.
