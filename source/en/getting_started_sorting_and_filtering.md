# Sorting and Filtering

Page information within the CMS is presented as tabular data in a grid format. **Grids** have a number of features that when combined create a flexible tool for Users making it easier to visualize and understand presented information.

Multiple filter fields can be used to restrict criteria for returned results.

- Use the checkbox to apply advanced filtering options for Names using Regex and provide AND/OR criteria using comma separated terms.

- The **Advanced** tab provides access to further filtering options for pages.

Results are populated into columns, which can be sorted by clicking on the column header or by using the Shift key to sort multiple columns that contain up/down arrows.

- Hold shift and click on the column headings to sort in the order selected.

The **Column Visibility** button is used to select/de-select which columns are needed in the data table, making it an extremely useful tool for Users to customise which columns should be visible for each grid.

If the number of columns selected can not fit to your screen size, the information will be hidden as additional rows, indicated by a + icon at the beginning of the row. Clicking on this icon will show the hidden information.

At the bottom of selected grids, a **With Selected** option is available for users to multi-select rows in order to easily perform bulk actions, such as Deleting, Sharing and moving items to Folders.

Use the row menu to access a set of actions for a selected item. Selected row menu actions across grids have an 'auto submit' capability. Once ticked the action will be automatically submitted without any further confirmation requirements when next selected.
