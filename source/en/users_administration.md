# User Management

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has different User types, each allowing a varying level of access across the CMS for efficient collaboration.

Administrators are encouraged to assign **Users** to **User Groups** to determine what the Users should access within the CMS and share **Folders** with the User to control the interaction (View, Edit, Delete)  of items contained within the Folder.

## Creating Users

Users are created and managed by clicking **Users** under the **Administration** section of the  main CMS menu.

- To add new Users, click on the **Add User** button. 

There are two ways in which Users can be added; via an onboarding wizard using pre-configured **User Groups** which have enabled **Features** for common functions to match the role or adding manually by completing a form.

- Follow the wizard by selecting a role to add them to a **User Group**, create a **User Name** and **Password** and select any **Folders** which need to be shared.
- If you need to set a **Home Folder** for the User, right click a Folder and use the **Set as Home** menu option.

Selecting to **Manually create a user**, will open the **Add User** form to complete.

A **User** will only have access to the parts of the CMS assigned to the User Group they belong to as well as full editing rights to their own items and the ability to share those with other Users.

Some Users may need additional access rights in order to perform the correct tasks, such as a **Group Admin**, who in addition to having access to the parts of the CMS as assigned to the User Group they belong to, they will also get access to all items of all Users belonging to the User Group.

**User Types** can be selected when creating a new User manually or by editing an existing User from the row menu.

Users are also assigned a dashboard which serves as a **Homepage**:

- The **Icon Dashboard** is the default **User** view and is intended as a launcher into other areas of the CMS.
- The **Status Dashboard** is a high level view for **Super Admin Users** which shows information relating to Library and Bandwidth usage as well as Display Activity.
- The **Media Manager Dashboard** gives an overview of the status of Library Media in the CMS.
- The **Playlist Dashboard** is only assigned to the **Playlist Dashboard User Group** which gives a restricted view of the CMS with a User only able to select specific Playlists to manage.

To make changes to a Users default, use the row menu and select edit and use the drop down menu for **Homepage**.

## Deleting Users

Deleting a User is irreversible and will remove all their owned items including; Media, Layouts and Schedules, even if these items are being used by other Users in the system. **Reassign items** to another User to make them the new owner of all the items currently owned by the User you wish to delete. Alternatively, use the **Retired** checkbox at the bottom of the **Edit User** form so that the items remain in use in the CMS.
