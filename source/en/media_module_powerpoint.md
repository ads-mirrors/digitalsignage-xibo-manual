# PowerPoint

Display PowerPoint presentations by selecting from one of the following options:

## 1. Add Video (RECOMMENDED)

For non-Windows Players / users with no full copy of PowerPoint to install, from Office 2010 onwards PowerPoint presentations can be exported as a **Video** file.   Export a PowerPoint file by using the option on the file menu from inside the PowerPoint application. 

{version}
**NOTE:** If your Players are Android or webOS devices you should ensure that the export format is MP4 (PowerPoint 2013 onwards) or convert your video to a MP4 using a 3rd party tool.
{/version}

Continue by adding [Video](media_module_video.html) to your Playlists and Layouts.

## 2. Add PDF

For non-Windows Players / users with no full copy of PowerPoint to install you can save your PowerPoint as a **PDF** file.

Continue by adding [PDF](media_module_pdf.html) to your Playlists and Layouts.

## 3. Upload a prepared PPT file (Windows Players only)

PowerPoint is a proprietary format from Microsoft and can only be displayed on a Windows-based signage player which has a full copy of Microsoft PowerPoint installed on each Windows Player. (Please see the [Prepare your Windows Players](media_module_powerpoint.html#content-prepare-your-windows-players) section)

### Prepare the PowerPoint Presentation.

PowerPoint will, by default, put scroll bars up the side of your presentation, unless you do the following for each PowerPoint file *BEFORE* you upload it:

1. Open your PowerPoint Document
2. Slide Show -> Set-up Show
3. Under "Show Type", choose "Browsed by an individual (window)" and then untick "Show scrollbar"
4. Click OK
5. Save the Presentation
6. Please note that [[PRODUCTNAME]] will not advance the slides in a Presentation, so you should record automatic slide timings by going to "Slide Show -> Rehearse Timings" and then save the presentation.

### Upload to CMS

Using the 'other media' search, use the **Type** drop down to select **PowerPoint**:

- Upload PPT files directly to Playlists/Layouts using the [Library Search](layouts_editor_using_library_search) from the toolbar.

- Files uploaded directly to Playlists and Layouts are automatically saved to the [Library](media_library.html) for re-use.
- PowerPoint files can also be uploaded in advance to the Library.
- Set [start and end times](media_playlists.html#content-widget-expiry-dates) for PowerPoint files uploaded directly to a Playlist.
- Save PowerPoint files to Folders on upload, to easily control access to Users.

## Prepare your Windows Players

Install PowerPoint on your Windows PC alongside your [[PRODUCTNAME]] Player and make the following adjustments to the Windows Registry to disable the windows prompt when opening the PowerPoint. **Please ensure you have taken all necessary precautions when making these changes**.

```registry
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PowerPoint.Show.12]
"BrowserFlags"=dword:00000002
"EditFlags"=dword:00010000

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PowerPoint.Show.8]
"BrowserFlags"=dword:00000002
"EditFlags"=dword:00010000

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PowerPoint.SlideShow.12]
"BrowserFlags"=dword:800000a0
"EditFlags"=dword:00010000

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PowerPoint.SlideShow.8]
"BrowserFlags"=dword:00000002
"EditFlags"=dword:00010000
```

If you do not feel comfortable changing the registry it may be possible to achieve the same results by waiting for [[PRODUCTNAME]] to open the first PowerPoint and then when the pop-up notification appears, choose to "Open" the file, and un-check the box so you won't be prompted again.

### Enable PowerPoint on Displays

You will need to ensure that the Windows [Display Setting Profile](displays_settings) used for the Displays you intend to use PowerPoint on, must be first enabled:

- Click on **Display Settings** under the **Displays** section of the main CMS menu.
- Use the row menu for the Windows Display Profile and select **Edit**.
- From the **General** tab, tick to **Enable PowerPoint**.
- **Save**.

### Advanced Steps

When displaying PowerPoint, [[PRODUCTNAME]] is relying on Windows and PowerPoint to display the content. This means that error capture and reporting is outside the control of [[PRODUCTNAME]]. To mitigate any issues we recommend disabling Windows error notifications. This can be done by following the [steps here](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-disable-error-reporting-in-windows-2626074). 

If you still experience issues, it may also be advisable to disable Office Application Error reporting by merging the registry patch below.

```reg
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common]
"DWNeverUpload"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Common]
"DWNeverUpload"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Common]
"DWNeverUpload"=dword:00000001
```

{version}
**NOTE:** The Windows player displays the PowerPoint presentation inside an Internet Explorer container. Internet Explorer uses the directory
`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.MSO` to cache Microsoft Office temporary files that are identified as being from the Internet security zone. This can cause multiple copies of the presentation to be saved to this directory over time. Windows does not automatically remove the cached duplicates from that directory, which can consume storage space on your hard drive over time. If you find multiple copies of your presentation cached at this directory it is safe to delete them. 

We would recommend creating a scheduled task or script that will delete the contents of that directory regularly.
