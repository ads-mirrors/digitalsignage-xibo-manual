# Mastodon

Display Mastodon social feed content anywhere on a Layout using Elements or include Static Templates with pre-styled designs in Layouts/Playlists.

{feat}Mastodon|v4{/feat}

The Mastodon Widget returns content from the URL entered for the [Module](media_modules.html) which feeds into configured Elements and Static Templates.

## Mastodon Elements

Elements are available for selection when adding a Mastodon Widget to a [Layout](layouts_editor.html) to give Users more control over what components of the Mastodon Widget to use and where they can be placed.

Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel. A **Hashtag** must be provided to return results from the **Configure** tab for each Element used on the Layout. Control how items should be cycled by specifying a [Data Slot](layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding Global Elements to add shapes and text which can all be put into an Element Group for easier configuration and positioning.

Take advantage of Stencils to add a predesigned group of Elements to your Layout.

{tip}
All Elements in the Stencil are treated as ‘one’ when configured and can be easily duplicated from a right click!

## Mastodon Static Templates

Static Templates define how returned items should be laid out and styled and are a simple way to show items using pre-styled templates.

Templates can be configured to affect the behaviour of returned results as well as make changes to the design appearance using a range of options in the Properties Panel. A **Hashtag** must be provided to return results from the **Configure** tab for each Template added to the Layout/Playlist.
