Welcome to the [[PRODUCTNAME]] User Manual. Whether you are a first time user or a user who wants to delve a bit deeper, the User Manual will help you maximise the full potential of all that [[PRODUCTNAME]] has to offer.

## First Time User

- Enter the web address **(URL)** of your CMS.
- Use the **Username** and **Password** provided to you.
- Click **Login**.

We recommend changing the **Password** after first log in from the **User Profile** located in the top right of the CMS:

- Click **Edit Profile** and enter your current Password.
- Enter a **New Password** and repeat in the **Retype New Password** field. 
- Click to **Save**.

Here you can also set your email address to ensure that notifications, password reminders etc. can be sent.

The **User Profile** has a number of **Preferences** that can be set as well as a link to **Reshow welcome** at anytime.

### Strengthen login security with Two Factor Authentication

Configure **Two Factor Authentication** options for either a code to be sent via **email** or enter the code as shown via the **Google Authenticator** app.

Once enabled and saved, you will need to generate **Recovery Codes** to be used if access the email or Google Authenticator app is lost:

- Click on **Generate**.
- **Copy** the codes and store them in a safe place like Password Manager.
- Click **Save** to make the codes active.

If you need to view the generated codes at anytime, click on **Show**.

### Notifications

User created messages and system events will be shown as **Notifications**, accessed from clicking the alarm bell icon located next to the **User Profile**. 

To add a Notification, click on **Notification Centre** and select **Add Notification** and complete the form fields.

## Showing content on Displays

- If you have image and video content created outside of the [[PRODUCTNAME]] CMS, follow the guidance in the **Getting Started** section to start uploading and scheduling content to your Displays.

- If you are going to create your content using the [[PRODUCTNAME]] CMS, begin with the **Layouts** section to start creating your own Layout designs either by modifying pre-designed **Templates** or by starting from a blank canvas.

If you have yet to create a **Display** in the CMS, take a look at the **Displays** section to **Connect** and **Authorise** Displays to start showing content.

## FAQs

***Are training materials available for a new user?***

We have a selection of videos which complement our user documentation, more information is available from our [Training](/training) page.

***I cannot retrieve my recovery codes, what should I do?***

If a User no longer has access to their email address/generated codes, an Administrator can reset these from the User grid. Once reset, take the steps to enable from the User Profile.

***What are My Applications from the User Profile?***

These are 3rd party applications that a User has authorised to act on their behalf within the CMS. An Administrator can add and configure Applications from the Administration section of the main CMS.

***I cannot see the Notification Drawer, to view or create?***

Notifications are enabled by an Administrator for a User using Features, tick to enable options for the appropriate access. Please ensure that a Sending Email address has been included on the Network tab from the Settings page, under the Administration section of the main CMS menu.

***What does the interrupt option do for Notifications?***
