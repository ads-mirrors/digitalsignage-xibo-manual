# [[PRODUCTNAME]] User Manual

**Revision: [[PRODUCTVERSION]]**

Management of a solution as flexible as [[PRODUCTNAME]] requires a powerful CMS (Content Management System) to control the core concepts. The [[PRODUCTNAME]] CMS is packed full of features to help you get the very best out of the [[PRODUCTNAME]] solution.

This User Manual covers the core concepts and CMS features and starts with a "Tour" to further explain what [[PRODUCTNAME]] can actually do...

**Note:** The User Manual gives a complete overview of the CMS as a Super Administrator with full access to all [Features and Sharing](users_features_and_sharing.html) options within the CMS.

If you have any questions regarding your User access, then please contact your Administrator.

# Welcome to the Tour!

[[PRODUCTNAME]] is a flexible and powerful application with a core ethos in Digital Signage for all, regardless of skill level or technological knowledge. 

The software itself centres on 5 core concepts:

- Users
- Displays
- Layouts
- Media
- Scheduling

Using these 5 concepts we can sum up what [[PRODUCTNAME]] can do in a simple sentence;

**"[[PRODUCTNAME]] enables a User to upload Media and arrange it in a Layout which is then Scheduled to one or more authorised Displays".**

[[PRODUCTNAME]] has many more features to take advantage of which are covered within this User Manual, but to get started let's take a quick look at the main 5.

## Users

[Users](users.html) are the people that are granted access to the CMS and are identified by a **Username** and **Password** to securely log in.

{tip}
For a corporate environment [[PRODUCTNAME]] can also integrate with SAML identity providers such as Active Directory via ADFS. 
{/tip}

[[PRODUCTNAME]] supports 3 [User Types](users_user_types.html), [User Groups](users_groups.html) as well as multi-level [Feature and Sharing](users_features_and_sharing.html) access to all parts and items stored within the CMS.

## Displays

[Displays](displays.html) represent the hardware connected to the TV/Projector/Tablet that is displaying the **Scheduled** end content. Each Display is uniquely identified in the CMS so that every Display can have its own content, Layout designs and Schedules set with uniquely identified reporting statistics available.

## Layouts

[Layouts](layouts.html) are the complete design that is seen on the screen. Layouts are made up of **Regions** which allows you to split the screen/position how you choose, with each Region containing its own **Playlist/Timeline** to which **Media Widgets** are assigned.  A Layout will remain on screen until all Regions have finished playing their assigned content through once, then an entirely fresh Scheduled Layout can be loaded that has different positioning/sizing of Regions and different Playlists/Timelines. 

This flexibility drives the dynamic nature of a [[PRODUCTNAME]] display screen.

## Media

[Media](media.html) content is at the core of the [[PRODUCTNAME]] solution and has many different types which can be generally split into two categories:

**File-based media** -  uploaded and stored in the [Library](media_library.html), for example, image and video files.

**Layout based media** - does not have an associated file and is configured directly on a Layout; RSS feeds and free Text

[[PRODUCTNAME]] uses powerful [Widgets](layouts_widgets.html) which allow you to show your content as well as integrating dynamic third-party information from a variety of sources.

## Scheduling

[Scheduling](scheduling.html) is highly flexible and supports Schedules to single **Displays** as well as to **Display Groups**. Each Display will check for new Scheduled content periodically, and download Scheduled Items in advance of playback. **Default Layouts** are shown on Displays when nothing else is Scheduled.

Throughout the documentation we have included tables to show **Player** and **CMS** version support for features and functionality:

## Open Source

The heart of the software is [Open Source](/open-source), including the entire **CMS** platform,**Windows** and **Ubuntu Players**, and has been for many years! We're committed to keeping it that way. 

The code can be downloaded and used in accordance with our AGPLv3 licence.

## Content Licensing
