Actions can be attached to an entire **Layout** a particular **Region** or specific **Widget** and can be used to effect changes to the Layout. These can be triggered by **Touch or Click** or programmatically by **webhook**.

{tip}
**Scenario**:
A Product display has a product that the customer can pick up. An 'internet of things' device, such as a light sensor could be used to trigger a webhook to [[PRODUCTNAME]] which loads that particular products information into a Region to be shown.
