The primary purpose of [[PRODUCTNAME]] is to show content on screens with the entire application suite existing for that one purpose. [[PRODUCTNAME]] provides a concept called **Displays** to manage when and how content is shown on a screen.

{tip}
When no other content is Scheduled, or if there is an issue that prevents the scheduled Event from showing, we highly recommend that a **Default Layout** is set so that something is **always** shown on Displays! You can create your own Default Layout to replace the existing one, but keep in mind that designs should be kept simple with no complex media or web content.  Edit a Display to select or use the Row Menu and click on Default Layout to select your designed Layout from the dropdown menu.

**Please note**: If no Default Layout is set or there is an issue with the Default Layout that has been set, the splash screen will be shown on Displays!

{/tip}

Displays are uniquely identified by a **hardware key** which is generated when the Signage Player software is installed. This hardware key is used to create a Display record in the CMS and is unique to that one Display record.

Administrator documentation for Player Installation guides can be found [here](/docs/setup)

## Connecting a Display

Displays connect to the CMS over an API called "XMDS" {nonwhite}(Xibo Media Distribution Service){/nonwhite} with most Players only requiring the URL and CMS Key. 

Alternatively, Displays can be added by providing a 6 character ‘Activation Code’ in the **Displays** page of the CMS.

{feat}Connect using Authentication Code|v3{/feat}
New Displays will need to be marked as **Authorised** before they can be sent any content. This can be done by using the Row Menu for the Display and clicking the **Authorise** action.


## Display Administration

Displays are administered in the CMS from clicking on **Displays** under the **Administration** section of the main menu.  The Displays [Grid](tour_grids.html) will open for you to add new and manage exiting Displays.

### Transfer Display to another CMS

{feat}Transfer Display to another CMS|v3{/feat}
To use this functionality you will first need to activate Google Authenticator using [Two factor Authentication](tour_two_factor_authentication.html), if you have not already set this up.

![Display Transfer Google Authenticator](img/displays_transfer_cms_google_authenticator.png)

Once activated, click on **Displays** from the CMS main menu and use the Row Menu to click on  **Transfer to another CMS** for the selected Display you want to transfer.

Ensure all the form fields are completed by:

- Entering the full **CMS URL** you wish to transfer this Display to.
- Providing the **CMS Secret Key** for the CMS Address you wish to transfer to.
- Complete the **Two Factor authentication code**, as displayed on the app.![Transfer CMS](img/displays_move_cms.png)

Once the details provided have been authenticated, the Display will attempt registration with the 'new' CMS. Once the Display has been successfully transferred the Display will stop communicating with the 'old' CMS and will change from a 'tick' to a `X` in the **Authorised** column.

{tip}
Select multiple Displays to transfer using the **With Selected** option at the bottom of the grid!

Certain Actions from the row menu have the option to be 'automatically submitted', see [Grids](tour_grids.html) for further information!
