# Menu Boards: Category

Display data for Categories held in a Menu Board anywhere on a Layout using **Elements**.

{feat}Menu Board: Category|v4{/feat}

The Menu Boards: Category Widget primarily consists of a Menu Board source which feeds into configured Elements.

[Menu Boards](media_menuboards.html) need to be created with defined Categories prior to adding the Menu Boards: Category Widget to Layouts.

## Category Elements

Elements are available for selection when adding a Menu Boards: Category Widget to a [Layout](layouts_editor.html) to give Users more control over what components of Menu Board Categories to use and where they can be placed.

Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel. A Menu Board must be selected to use as the data source from the **Configure** tab for each Element used on the Layout. Control how items should be cycled by specifying a [Data Slot](layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding Global Elements to add shapes and text which can all be put into an Element Group for easier configuration and positioning.

## Overview

- Update Elements with new Category data by editing the underlying [Menu Board](media_menuboards.html#content-create-and-configure-categories) data.
- Update Menu Board: Category  Widget content without accessing Layouts.
- Content for this media is cached by the Players for off-line playback.
- Use with the [Menu Boards: Products](media_module_menuboards_products.html) Widget to easily create a menu/catalogue of items for your Category to show on Displays.
