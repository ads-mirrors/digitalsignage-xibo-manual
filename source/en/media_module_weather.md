Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel.  Enter the geographical location and units to return results from the **Configure** tab.

Control how items should be cycled by specifying a Data Slot to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding Global Elements to add shapes and text which can all be put into an Element Group for easier configuration and positioning.

All Layouts that use the Weather Widget need to include attribution, available by using the Attribution Element.  Static Templates contain this tag by default.
