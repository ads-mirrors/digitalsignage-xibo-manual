## Editing Preset Templates (Advanced Use)

Preset templates can be edited by clicking in the **Override the template** checkbox.

{tip}
The template will be automatically scaled and should be designed for the intended output resolution. The following guidelines should be considered when editing templates:

- Templates must be designed at a fixed size
- All elements must use absolute sizing in px, including fonts, margins, widths, heights, etc
- If positioning is used, it must be from top,left
- Templates can use bootstrap
- The aspect ratio will be fixed by [[PRODUCTNAME]] and sized to fit the Region
- Templates are treated the same as a static image
  {/tip}

With override template selected, you can enter text, HTML and CSS.

Once override has been selected, click back on the **Templates tab** to select templates to edit:

![Weather Template Override](img/v3.1_media_weather_override_template.png)

### Current Forecast Template

Also known as the main template, used for the current weather conditions and as the basis for the repeating Daily Forecast Template.

Toggle **On** the Visual editor to access the inline editor to enter text and formatting or provide text/HTML in the box provided. 

Use the drop down to include **Snippets**.

{tip}
Click on **Get Forecast** to see available substitutions to use.
{/tip}

### Daily Forecast Template

This is the **repeating template** that should be provided for the 7 day forecast. It will be repeated each day and then substituted into the special `[dailyForecast]` tag (which should feature on the main Current Forecast template). 

The `[dailyForecast]` tag has 2 optional settings which can be added to the tag by including the`|` character. These are `[dailyForecast|Number of days|Start day]` and default to 7 days, starting at tomorrow (day 2). If you wanted to see the next 3 days you would use `[dailyForecast|3]` and for a 3 day forecast starting the day after tomorrow you could use `[dailyForecast|3|3]`.
{tip}  
A common example is to ignore the "Current Template" and produce a full 7 day forecast using the Daily Forecast - this is achieved with `[dailyForecast|7|1]`.
{/tip}

### Style Sheet

This is the CSS to apply to the template structure above.

{tip}
This optional template is intended for advanced users to 'tweak' the CMS generated output!
{/tip}

### Attribution

All Layouts that use the Weather Widget need to include attribution, available by using the `[Attribution]` tag. All preset templates contain this tag by default, please ensure that this tag is included when editing/overriding default templates.

### Caching

Enter the Update Interval to be applied, in minutes, kept as high as possible. 

{tip}
If the data will only change once per hour the Update Interval could be set to 60.
{/tip}

### Get Forecast

It is possible to **request a forecast** at any time to see what forecast data is returned. Any field is available as a substitute in the template by entering the field name between square 
brackets - for example `[nearestStormDistance]`.
