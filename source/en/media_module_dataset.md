# DataSet

Display data held in a DataSet anywhere on a Layout using **Elements** or include **Static Templates** to show Tickers and Tables of data in Layouts/Playlists.

{feat}DataSets|v4{/feat}

The DataSet Widget primarily consists of a DataSet source which feeds into configured Elements and Static Templates.

[DataSets](media_datasets.html) need to be created and defined prior to adding the DataSet Widget to Layouts/Playlists.

## DataSet Elements

[Elements](layouts_editor#content-data-widgets-and-elements) are available for selection when adding a DataSet Widget to a [Layout](layouts_editor.html) to give Users more control over what components of the DataSet Widget to use and where they can be placed.

You will see a message in the properties panel should you try to use an Element that has no matching field type in your DataSet!
{/tip}

Each Element has a set of configuration options in the Properties Panel. A DataSet must be selected to use as the data source from the **Configure** tab for each Element used on the Layout. Control how items should be cycled by specifying a [Data Slot](layouts_editor.html#content-data-slots) to use for each of the added Elements. Data Elements can be further complimented by adding Global Elements to add shapes and text which can all be put into an Element Group for easier configuration and positioning.

## DataSet Static Templates

Static Templates define how returned data should be laid out and styled and are a simple way to show your data using pre-styled templates.

Templates can be configured to affect the behaviour of returned results as well as make changes to the design appearance using a range of options in the Properties Panel. A DataSet must be selected to use as the data source from the **Configure** tab for each Template added to the Layout/Playlist.

## Overview

- Update Elements and Templates with new data by editing the underlying [DataSet](media_datasets.html#content-adding-data-to-columns) data.
- Update DataSet Widget content without accessing Layouts or Playlists.
- Order and Filter results by any column.

- Shuffle items to play in a random sequence.
- Content for this media is cached by the Players for off-line playback.
- Set a 'freshness check' to determine when to switch to the 'No data' message when a Player is offline.
